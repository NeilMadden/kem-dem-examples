# KEM/DEM Examples

This repository provides **toy** implementations of KEM/DEM paradigm
public key encryption schemes based on a [series of blog posts](https://neilmadden.blog/2021/01/22/hybrid-encryption-and-the-kem-dem-paradigm/)
by Neil Madden.

**WARNING:** these implementations are toys intended for learning and are not
suitable for production use. They almost certainly have severe security vulnerabilities!
